# GWG_analysis
## About the Project

This study attempts to examine political party affiliation and enactment of pay transparency laws as determinants of state Gender Wage Gaps(GWGs) in the United States. While it was found that party affiliation is a prominent factor explaining GWGs, whether the state has a pay transparency law was not found to have a significant relationship with state GWGs. This finding has important implications as it highlights the need for further exploration of what policy measures can help to lower GWGs. Future work on the interactions between politics and policies can prove useful in informing the design of policies which can close gender-based wage gaps thereby enabling society to tap into the full potential of human capital.

This code excerpt focuses on the Exploratory Data Analysis and Regression conducted to explore the determinants of GWGs in the United States.

## Dataset Construction

A panel dataset was used for analysis containing GWG for those employed, political party affiliation, state-level pay transparency prohibition laws and their year of enactment as well as various control variables for the years 2010-2019. The final dataset was constructed at a state-year level. 


## Pre-requisites

The dataset used for analysis is given in the repository and is titled "GWG.csv".

The following packages require installation:
- conda install -c conda-forge ffmpeg (for generating maps)
